# JS_test_Mini_Game
A mini dice game, created using HTML, CSS and JS.

1. There are two players who play in turns.
2. Every turn a player's rolls are unlimited and every rolled score is added to the overall score.
3. If a player rolls 1 (doesn't matter which dice), all the score is set back to 0.
4. Player can press "UŽLAIKYTI" and hold his points in case he doesn't want to lose the score. Holding the points automatically passes the turn to the orther player.
